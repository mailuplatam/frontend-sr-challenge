## Description of the challenge.

This is a list of clients that shows a lot of information about them, the main component has all the logic in one place and it's not right, we need you to take it to the next level, adding routes, creating and separating into components to reuse them in the screens to create, making the design according to the rest of the app and modify it to make it more beautiful, improve the user experience with modals, new screens, micro animations and in this way you will give this little app an opportunity to grow and scale over time.

As users we want to see the list of clients, search clients, add new clients, modify clients, delete clients and see the details of the clients individually.

* Information about people you know and people you may know should not be added in the add and modify customer forms (the purpose of this information is to have more visual material and information to play with).

* The forms must be able to interact with the API and pass the validation that the API has, the API will respond to success or error messages in each case, but will not add or modify the data in the database.

* The API unfortunately is not working fine, the response maybe can fall in a 429 error or 500 error in certain moments (We need to take actions here to use a retry or show corrects messages to the users).

* The API uses a token to pass the security, put it in a safe place.

* When we select a contact, see the details isn't working anymore, this happened after a new deployment in the backend.
