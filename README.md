# Frontend Senior Software Engineer UI/UX
We are seeking a talented frontend senior software engineer with a strong background in UI/UX design. The ideal candidate will have a good understanding of many technical aspects and will be able to demonstrate their skills in creating user interfaces and improving user experience.

## Challenge
The challenge is to improve a client list application. The current main component has all the logic in one place and it needs to be refactored to take it to the next level by adding routes, creating and separating components, and improving the design.
The goals of the challenge are to:
* Show proficiency in using the composition API of Vue 3.
* Show micro animations and a smooth navigation (router, buttons, loading, validations, etc.).
* Use Vuex or Pinia to maintain the app's state.
* Create and use a component pattern to allow for reusability across the app.
* Read a Postman collection and understand how the REST API works (Frontend challenge.postman_collection.json).
* Understand and access complex JSON and retrieve data correctly.
* Pay attention to the API response status to display the correct message.
* Write tests to ensure the app works as expected.
* Write a clear and easy-to-follow README to test the app.



## Functionality

As users, we want to be able to:
* View a list of clients.
* Search for clients.
* Add new clients.
* Modify existing clients.
* Delete clients.
* View the details of individual clients.

Note: Information about people you know and people you may know should not be included in the add and modify client forms.
The forms must interact with the API and pass the API's validation. The API will respond with success or error messages, but will not add or modify data in the database.

## API Considerations
Please note that the API may not be functioning correctly and may return a 429 or 500 error at times. It is important to implement a retry mechanism or display appropriate messages to the users in such cases. The API uses a token for security, so it is important to keep it safe.
Additionally, the ability to view client details is not currently working after a recent backend deployment.

## Summary
In this challenge, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your skills in UI/UX design, Vue 3, and API interaction. You will improve a client list application by adding routes, separating components, and improving the design, among other tasks. This is a great opportunity to showcase your skills and take this little app to the next level.
